        About LBrowser: Your Submarine for the Web
      </h2>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
        <p>
          Meet LBrowser (Little Browser) – a compact, open-source browser built with a singular focus: empowering you to explore the web safely and without surveillance. Think of it as your small, secure submarine, ready to navigate not just the surface web, but also hidden networks like Tor, I2P, Zeronet, and Hyphanet.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike large, data-hungry browsers, LBrowser respects your privacy. It uses the reliable Chromium rendering engine via a webview but fundamentally differs by having <strong class="text-foreground">no interest in your data</strong>. We don't sell, store, or track your Browse activity – ever.
        </p>

        <p>
            LBrowser makes accessing alternative web networks easy. With <strong class="text-foreground">integrated Docker container support</strong>, you can activate "web modes" for networks like Tor or I2P with a simple click, abstracting away complex configurations (Docker needs to be running on your system). It's about making these powerful tools accessible to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is built and maintained by me, in my free time, driven by the belief in a more open and private web. It's currently available for Linux and Windows, with plans for more platforms in the future.
