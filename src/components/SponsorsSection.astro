  <p class="mb-6">
    LBrowser is a passion project developed in my free time. It will always remain free, open-source, and committed to never selling or exploiting your data. Your support is crucial for keeping the project alive and driving its development forward.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    You can sponsor the project via Ko-fi. A unique way to contribute is by sponsoring specific "commissions" or feature requests from the community. The feature idea with the most community sponsorship will become a top priority for implementation in upcoming versions. It's a direct way to influence LBrowser's roadmap!
