## Ways to Contribute

LBrowser is a community-supported, open-source project, and any form of contribution is highly valued and appreciated.

Simply by **using LBrowser** and finding it helpful, you are already making a significant contribution! Knowing that the project serves its purpose and benefits users is incredibly motivating.

If you wish to contribute further, here are several ways you can help:

* **Report Issues:** If you encounter any bugs or unexpected behavior, please let us know! Reporting issues helps identify areas that need fixing. Refer to the [Reporting Issues](/docs/issues) section for guidelines on how to submit effective bug reports via GitHub.
* **Spread the Word:** Help give LBrowser visibility! Share the project with friends, colleagues, or on social media if you believe in its mission and features. Increasing awareness helps grow the community.
* **Star on GitHub:** If you have a GitHub account, starring the [LBrowser repository](https://github.com/poullorca/lbrowser) is a simple but effective way to show your support and help the project gain visibility within the open-source community.
* **Provide Financial Support:** As detailed in the [Contribution & Sponsorship Model](/docs/sponsorship) section, you can support the project financially via Ko-fi. This is the only direct form of monetization and helps dedicate more time and resources to development.
* **Contribute Code:** If you are a developer, you are welcome to contribute directly to the project's codebase. Check out the repository on GitHub, look at open issues, or propose improvements via pull requests. Refer to the building instructions in the [Deployment & Installation](/docs/install) section and any specific contribution guidelines in the repository.

Every contribution, no matter how small, helps LBrowser move forward and continue to provide a valuable, privacy-respecting Browse option. Thank you for your support!
