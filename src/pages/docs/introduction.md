# Introduction

In today's digital landscape, the way we access and interact with information online is increasingly shaped by entities that prioritize data collection and user profiling. Mainstream browsers, while powerful, often come bundled with tracking mechanisms and business models that treat personal data as a commodity. This paradigm shift can subtly, or not so subtly, influence what we see and how we perceive the vastness of the internet.

LBrowser (Little Browser) is born from a different vision: a belief in an open, accessible, and private web for everyone. It's designed as a deliberate counterpoint to the data-hungry status quo. Our fundamental philosophy is rooted in respecting user privacy and empowering exploration without surveillance.

The core principle is simple: **Your data is yours, and yours alone.** LBrowser is built from the ground up to never collect, store, sell, or process your Browse data for profit or training purposes. We believe that your journey across the web should be free from prying eyes and algorithmic filtering aimed at profiting from your habits.

Beyond privacy, LBrowser is designed to facilitate broader exploration. The internet is more than just the surface web; it includes resilient, decentralized networks like Tor, I2P, Zeronet, and Hyphanet. Accessing these often requires technical know-how and complex configurations. LBrowser aims to lower this barrier significantly, integrating seamless access to these "web modes" via Docker containers, allowing you to "Go Further" and discover content beyond the conventional reach.

LBrowser is a lightweight, open-source project. This transparency ensures that anyone can inspect the code and verify its commitment to privacy and security. It's a project driven by passion for a more open and private internet, developed in my free time.

This documentation serves as your guide to understanding LBrowser's philosophy, features, how to get it running, and how you can contribute to its development and vision.
