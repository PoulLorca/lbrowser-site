## Roadmap

The development of LBrowser is an ongoing journey towards a more open, private, and accessible web. This roadmap provides insight into the project's current status, what's actively being worked on, and how the community can influence future development.

### Current Version: LBrowser-1.0-SNAPSHOT (PRE)

The latest available version is the `LBrowser-1.0-SNAPSHOT (PRE)` pre-release. This version represents the first functional iteration of LBrowser and includes the core features:

* Integrated Network Modes for:
    * Tor
    * I2P
    * Hyphanet
    * Zeronet
* Built-in Ad-Free Mode
* Media Source Extraction Mode

This pre-release allows users to experience the fundamental capabilities of LBrowser and provides a base for ongoing development and testing.

### Upcoming for 1.0 Stable

Development is actively underway to transition from the `1.0-SNAPSHOT (PRE)` to the stable `1.0` release. Key focus areas for the stable version include refining existing features, improving stability, and enhancing the security of the integrated components.

Specific developments for the 1.0 stable release include:

- [ ] Developing and integrating proprietary (self-sourced/audited) Docker images for **Zeronet**.
- [ ] Developing and integrating proprietary (self-sourced/audited) Docker images for **Tor**.
- [ ] General bug fixes and performance improvements based on pre-release feedback.

The goal is to ensure the 1.0 stable release provides a solid, secure, and reliable foundation for LBrowser's unique features.

### Community-Sponsored Features (Commissions)

This section of the roadmap is dedicated to features proposed and prioritized by the LBrowser community through the Ko-fi commission system (as detailed in the [Contribution & Sponsorship Model](#contribution--sponsorship-model) section).

Features listed here represent development tasks that have received sufficient community sponsorship to be added to the prioritized roadmap for upcoming versions (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, etc.) following the 1.0 stable release.

Currently, there are no community-sponsored features actively being commissioned. As features are proposed and funded by the community, they will be added to the table below, outlining their progress towards implementation.

| Feature Name | Sponsor Username / Identifier | Amount Contributed (This instance) | Total Amount for Feature | Estimated Delivery | Status |
| :----------- | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------- | :----- |
| *(No community-sponsored features yet)* |                               |                                    |                          |                    |        |
|              |                               |                                    |                          |                    |        |

If you have a feature idea you'd like to see prioritized, consider commissioning it via the [LBrowser Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/lbrowser). Your contribution directly influences what gets built next after the core 1.0 stable release.
