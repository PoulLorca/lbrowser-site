## Contribution & Sponsorship Model

LBrowser is a personal project, developed and maintained solely by one individual (myself). It is built upon existing open-source components and is itself entirely open source. Our goal is maximum transparency and accessibility for everyone.

It's crucial to understand that LBrowser is **not** conceived as a commercial product. It is free, always will be free, and will remain open source. There are no plans to monetize it through user searches, in-browser sponsorships, or any method that compromises the user experience or privacy. The aim is simplicity and transparency in its operation and philosophy.

However, if you appreciate LBrowser, value the work that goes into it, and would like to help dedicate more time to its development and improvement, you can provide support. The sole dedicated platform for financial support is **Ko-fi**.

Your contributions through Ko-fi are deeply appreciated as they are the only means of support for this project, which has no other form of monetization.

### Supporting via Ko-fi

On the [LBrowser Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/lbrowser), you can find different ways to support the project:

* **One-time Donations:** Make a single contribution of any amount you choose.
* **Recurring Donations:** Set up a regular contribution to provide ongoing support.
* **Feature Commissions:** This is a unique way to directly influence the LBrowser roadmap by sponsoring specific feature requests or ideas.

### Feature Commissions Explained

Feature Commissions allow the community to prioritize development tasks. If you have a specific feature you'd like to see implemented or prioritized, you can commission it through Ko-fi.

**Commission Process Summary:**

1.  **Submission:** Submit your feature request via the commission option on the [LBrowser Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/c/02078bbd1a). Your support and interest are genuinely valued upon submission.
2.  **Review:** Once received, your request will undergo a thorough review. Please allow **5 to 10 days** for this process.
3.  **Response:** You will receive a personal response via the contact email you provide, detailing the outcome of the review. The request may be:
    * Added to the development roadmap.
    * Merged with an existing, similar idea already on the roadmap.
    * Declined, with a clear explanation of the reasons why it cannot be included at this time.
4.  **Prioritization:** Feature ideas that receive community sponsorship through commissions are given priority consideration on the development roadmap. Ideas with higher levels of sponsorship signal greater community interest and are more likely to be prioritized for upcoming versions.

**Important Notes on Commissions:**

* **Commissions are Final:** Please be aware that all commissions are final. There are **no refunds or cancellations** once a feature request has been submitted. This policy is in place because time and resources are dedicated to the careful review and analysis of each submission, regardless of the final decision on its inclusion in the roadmap.
* **Required Information:** When submitting your commission request, please include:
    * A contact email address for communication regarding your request.
    * A detailed description of the feature, explaining what it should do, how it should function, and where it would fit within the browser interface.
    * An explanation of the expected behavior or goal of the feature – what problem does it solve, or how does it improve LBrowser?
    * Optionally, include any examples, sketches, or references that might help illustrate your idea.

Your decision to support LBrowser, whether through a general donation or a specific commission, directly helps fund the time and effort required to maintain and improve the project. Your contribution helps shape a more open, private, and accessible web.

### Alternative Sponsorship & Contact
