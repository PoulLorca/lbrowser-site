# First Look: LBrowser-1.0-SNAPSHOT (PRE) is Now Available!

We are thrilled to announce the release of **LBrowser-1.0-SNAPSHOT (PRE)**, the very first publicly available version of the LBrowser project!

This pre-release is available as fully portable builds for both **Windows (x64)** and **Linux (x64)**. Simply download the respective ZIP/TGZ file, extract it, and you can start using LBrowser right away â€“ no installation required.

This marks a significant first step for the project. Making this initial version available allows you to get a tangible feel for LBrowser's core features, explore its privacy-focused approach, and see how it simplifies access to alternative web networks. It's an invitation to get to know the project and hopefully get involved!

We are incredibly excited about this milestone and the potential for LBrowser to help many people navigate the web more freely and safely, truly empowering them to **Go Further!**

You can download the LBrowser-1.0-SNAPSHOT (PRE) from our [Download Page](/download) or directly from the [GitHub Releases](YOUR_GITHUB_RELEASE_LINK).

Try it out and let us know what you think!
